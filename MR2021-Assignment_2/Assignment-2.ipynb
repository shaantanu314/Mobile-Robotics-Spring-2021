    "# Introduction to types of Transformations and Homogeneous coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "In robotics applications, it is inevitable to keep track of the frames of multiple objects/worlds. These frames can be transformations from one coordinate frame to the other. **Homogeneous coordinates** help in keeping track of various coordinate frames and allow performing composition of various transforms. We will first try to understand between types of transformations and their invariant properties.\n",
    "1. What is the difference between Affine, Similarity, and Euclidean transform? What are the invariant properities of each type of transform?\n",
    "2. Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvEl63t-opM) to briefly understand homogeneous coordinates. What are points at infinity? What type of transformation can you apply to transform a point from infinity to a point that is not at infinity? \n",
    "3. Using homogeneous coordinates we can represent different types of transformation as point transforms vs. frame transforms. Concatenation of transforms (whether you post multiply transformation matrices or pre-multiply transformation matrices) depends on the problem and how you are viewing it. Try to understand the difference between frame vs. point transformations from this [video](https://youtu.be/Za7Sdegf8m8?t=1834). Let's assume that our camera and world frames are coinciding with each other. We need to estimate the camera to world **frame** transformation matrix after applying the transformations defined below in terms of $T_i$.We apply **frame** transform to move the camera in the world in the following order:\n",

    "### Solution 1\n",
    "#### Affine Transformation:\n",
    "Affine transformation is a type of transformation in which the laws such as parallelism and collinearity of points is preserved. After the transformation, all points lying on a line still lie on a line ad the ratio of distances between points are also preserved. ( Eg: The midpoint of a given line remains the same even after transformation.)\n",
    "\n",
    "While an affine transformation preserves proportions on lines, it does not necessarily preserve angles or lengths.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Similarity Transformation:\n",
    "Similarity transformations are transformation in which the shape of the object under transformation ,ie, the geometry , angles etc are preserved. This involves rotation , translation , reflection and scaling operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Euclidean Transformation:\n",
    "Euclidean transformation is most rigid transformation of the above two. It involves only translation , rotation and reflection. In this transformation , since scaling is not involved, the size of the object is preserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Homogeneous coordinates are projective coordinates of euclidean space represented in 4 diensional vectors. The last row has a scalar by which if we divide all the other rows, we get back the euclidean coordinates.If we fix this last row scalar to 0 , we can represnt infinitely far points in homogeneous coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following transformations possible in homogeneous coordinates.\n",
    "<img src=\"./img/homogeneoustransforms.png\" width=\"50%\"  >\n",
    "\n",
    "To bring a point at infinity, the scalr in the last row must be non-zero in the last row.\n",
    "Consider the transformation matrix:\n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "t11 & t12 & t13 &t14 \\\\\n",
    "t21 & t22 & t23 & t24 \\\\\n",
    "t31 & t32 & t33 & t34 \\\\\n",
    "t41 & t42 & t43 & t44 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "And consider a point at infinity whose homogeneous coordinated is given as:\n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "x \\\\\n",
    "y \\\\\n",
    "z \\\\\n",
    "0 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "\n",
    "After the transformation, the scalar in the last row of homogeneous coordinates is given as:\n",
    "          \n",
    "                  t41*x + t42*y +t43*z + t44*(0)\n",
    "In all the transformations except projective transsformation , \n",
    "\n",
    "                    (t41 ,t42 , t43 ) = (0,0,0)\n",
    "While in projective tranformation , it is \n",
    "\n",
    "                    (t41 ,t42 , t43 ) = pT\n",
    "So, we can bring point at infinity to a point that is not at infinity, we can use projective transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution 3\n",
    "\n",
    "We premultiply the transformation matrix if we want to perform the transformation in the world coordinate frame while we post multiply if we want to perform the rotation in the camera's frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the final transformation matrix is given as:\n",
