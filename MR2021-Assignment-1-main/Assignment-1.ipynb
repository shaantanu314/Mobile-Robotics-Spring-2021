    "### Quaternions\n",
    "Quaternions are a 4D representation of rotations in 3D space. It is popular in graphics because:\n",
    "1. Since they are 4D representation of 3D rotations, they are sufficient enough to represent the rotations without any ambiguity. Quaternion Representation is not prone to Gimbal locks because of this feature.\n",
    "2. Although it is difficult to imagize 4D representations and their projections/effects in warping 3D spaces, It is very easy in computational sense. It is similar to complex number operations and is free from matrix operations.\n",
    "3. Since each quaternion requires only 4 real numbers to be representated, it requires less memory and is computationally efficient."

    "## Solution:\n",
    "#### Why octomaps are memory efficient\n",
    "Octomaps are generated by using an efficient datastructure caled as Octrees. An octree is an heirarchical datastructure used for spatial subdivision in computer vision. At each node we can either divide the space into eight smaller voxels if the current bigger voxel isnt  completely unoccupied or we can stop dividing if it is completely unoccupied . We recursively subdivide unless we reach minimum sized voxel ,ie, the resolution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are not storing each and every cell as individual resolution sized voxels and rather we are only dividing a bigger cell if it is not completely unoccupied, this leads to saving a lot of memory which makes them memory efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When and why do we update an octomap\n",
    "\n",
    "We update an octomap when we recieve information from the sensors. Since the sensors are erroneous, we will always have a probability whether the laser was reflected or it travelled through the reflecting volume. When we move through the space, we need to scan the surroundings occasionally , which leads to updating the octomaps wherever neccesary.\n",
    "Each time we have a scan using sensors, we have current measurements and prior probability that the volume was occupied upto previous readings . Using this , we get conditional probabilty of occupancy of the voxel. If it is greater than a particular threshold, we say that the voxel is occupied. This leads to update in the octomaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When do we use octomap instead of point cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use octomaps for problems involving trajectory planing ,ex, path planing for drones. Planing paths using octomaps are computationally efficient and also easier problem . Using point clouds for such problems can be very difficult to solve and may also require lot of memory."
